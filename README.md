# JS Utilities

A faux-monorepo of various generic utilities I've built for projects that are
useful

## NOTICE

At the time of writing, much of the code in here is lightly touched up from the
projects they came from, removing any project-specific aspects. The code quality
tools, testing, and package publishing are yet to come as I have free time to do
them. For now, these are basically copy/paste into your project. Feel free to
adapt the test cases to your test runner of choice. Given that, all code is
available for use to anyone as-is (attribution always appreciated) but I provide
no guarantee of quality out of the box. You need to vet my code for yourself.

## Packages

### [Composers](./packages/composers/README.md)

use cases.
